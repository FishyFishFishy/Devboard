# Devboard
This is a simple devboard that uses an RP2040

I recently developed an interest in electrical engineering a couple months ago, but was not sure where to start. I've followed the hackclub blueprint instructions to help me build this devboard. The purpose of building this was to get practice with pcb design on KiCad. I also hope to be able to use this devboard for a future project with making an inverted pendulum.

You can use this devboard by plugging it in via USB Type-C and flashing whatever you need onto it.
